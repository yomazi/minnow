  <strong>Os Mutantes</strong> ("The Mutants") are an influential Brazilian psychedelic rock band
  that were linked with the Tropicália movement of the late 1960s. When Os Mutantes was formed, it
  combined influences from psychedelic acts from the English-speaking world like The Beatles, Jimi
  Hendrix, and Sly &amp; the Family Stone with bossa nova, tropicália, samba and the cultural legacy
  of the Brazilian art vanguards from the modernist movement.

  One of the most well-known and influential rock bands in Brazil, Os Mutantes are cited as a major
  influence to many contemporary underground or independent bands in the United States and Europe.
  Beck paid tribute to the group with his single "Tropicália" from the album Mutations. The Bees (UK
  band) covered "A Minha Menina" on their first album, <em>Sunshine Hit Me</em>. Red Hot Chili
  Peppers bass player Flea has stated on his Twitter account that he is a fan. Kevin Barnes of Of
  Montreal cites Os Mutantes as an important influence. Talking Heads frontman David Byrne has
  worked to publish and promote the group's music through his Luaka Bop label. Kurt Cobain publicly
  requested a reunion tourfrom the trio in 1993, writing a letter to Arnaldo Baptista, but the bands
  first live performance since 1978 was at London’s Barbican Arts Centre on May 22, 2006.

and <strong>Claudio Tchernev</strong> on drums the band toured extensively enjoying some great
highlights such as "A Minha Menina" featuring as the audio track for the McDonald's commercial
“Victory” in June 2008, their first new release in 35 years, <em>Haih Or Amortecedor</em> (ANTI-

album <em>Fool Metal Jack</em>. In 2017, Sergio Dias collaborated with the English

<strong>Sugar Candy Mountain</strong>
<p class="helping" a="" neo-psychedelic="" of="" pop="" revival="" spearhead="" to=""
  >Sugar Candy Mountain fuses sunny, retro sounds with lush, sophisticated composition. Blending
  classic '60s West Coast psychedelia with pastoral folk and pulling inspiration from pop
  experimentalists and Brazilian Tropicalia. Their latest album <em>Do Right</em>&nbsp;takes a more
  modern approach layering vibrant synths alongside more organic instrumentation. Oscillating
  between the hazy psychedelic pop of Mild High Club, the driving energy of Tame Impala and the
  danceable familiarity of The Supremes, the band is a perfect cocktail of old and new, imploring
  the listener to take a ride into the sunset with Sugar Candy Mountain.
